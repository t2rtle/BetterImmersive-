***BetterImmersive+** is a modpack created by @t2rtle, joining some Open Source mods to improve the vanilla of Minecraft leaving much more immersive and realistic. However, some mods included in the modpack need credits, so I created this GitHub to store a list with all the mods used (with the link to each) in the project.*
